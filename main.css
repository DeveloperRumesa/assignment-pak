/* display: flex – What It Does
When you apply display: flex to a container element, you're telling the browser:
“Lay out this element’s children in a flexible, one-dimensional row or column.”
It turns the container into a Flex Container, and the direct children become Flex Items.
🔹 Key Concepts
One-dimensional = you layout elements in either a row or a column, not both at the same time (that’s for Grid).
The flex container takes control of the layout and spacing of its items using properties like:
justify-content → controls horizontal alignment
align-items → controls vertical alignment
flex-direction → sets row or column layou 
What Happens?
display: flex puts items in a row by default (flex-direction: row).
justify-content: center, centers items horizontally.
align-items: center, centers items vertically (within the container height).
